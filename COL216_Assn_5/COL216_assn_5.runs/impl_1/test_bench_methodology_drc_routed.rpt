2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.120 ns between cpu/reg_reg[15][7]_P/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and cpu/reg_reg[7][31]/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#2 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -1.607 ns between cpu/reg_reg[15][7]_P/C (clocked by sys_clk_pin) and cpu/Z_flag_reg/D (clocked by sys_clk_pin). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
